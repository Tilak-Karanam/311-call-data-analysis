# 📞 311 Call Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes and models 311 non-emergency service request data from four U.S. cities: **Boston**, **Buffalo**, **Chicago**, and **Washington**. It demonstrates my ability to clean and transform real-world datasets, normalize relational structures, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and apply a basic machine learning model for predictive insights.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Combine and clean multiple city-wise 311 datasets
- Normalize the data into a structured relational format
- Analyze trends in request types, resolution times, and departmental workloads
- Predict the resolution status of 311 cases using a Naive Bayes classifier

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Cleaning & Integration**: Merged multiple raw CSV files into a single consistent dataset
- **Relational Data Modeling**: Designed normalized tables for department, location, and case data
- **EDA & Visualization**: Identified key patterns and insights using `pandas` and `matplotlib`
- **Machine Learning**: Built a classification model to predict resolution outcomes using `scikit-learn`
- **Notebook Documentation**: Explained the workflow step-by-step in Jupyter Notebook

## 📍 About the Project

311 call data provides insights into non-emergency services requested by citizens across different U.S. cities. This project simulates how municipalities can use historical 311 data to understand public service demand, optimize departmental workflows, and predict resolution timelines. The dataset is modeled relationally and analyzed to support city planning and resource allocation.
